[Forecasting Mini-Course Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e19)

A Kaggle competition where the goal is to predict a year worth of sales (for 2022) of fictional learning modules from fictional Kaggle branded stores in different countries. The provided dataset is synthetically generated, however, it is still modeled from real world data. As a result, it includes many realistic features that would reflect a production situation.

A [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) that offers a solution to the above challenge via using an ensemble of Gradient Boosting Machines to predict future sales.

This notebook is also hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/skuldropr/forecasting-mini-course-sales), so you can run and or edit the code yourself for free.
